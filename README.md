This is a group project, and I was responsible for implementing some of the filtering functions, and also the geocoding and displaying the Google Map.

To see the Map, search for the band name, and checkout its details page

To run the code: cd into the mainfunction folder, and use "go run ."

Note: I have restricted the API key to my IP address only.
